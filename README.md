# ocado-Task-Red-Eye
I did it and tried to optimize it. I didnt have time to make it work. From all my code cant recognise 1 square. Sorry for this have a great day/night


run the file from main.py you need to have numpy and einops installed

the solution searches for eyes trought the image and replaces them. it goes trough every row and every 5th square that way it checks only 20% of everything
